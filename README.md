# üöÄ Project Setup Guide
# üõ†Ô∏è Predictive Maintenance MVP for Manufacturing Units

# Team Force
This project is a working MVP for detecting **unplanned machine downtime** in **mid-sized manufacturing units** using real-time sensor data, predictive analytics, and a clean dashboard interface.

> ‚úÖ **Deployed Version**: https://force-hackronyx-mvp-frontend.vercel.app/

## üåê Project Overview

The system simulates real-time machine data using sensors such as:

- Torque sensors
- Vibration sensors (ADXL345)
- Current sensors (ACS712)
- Temperature sensors (DS18B20)
- Strain gauges (HX711)
- RPM (Hall Effect)
- Operating Hours (RTC + EEPROM)

The backend ingests the simulated data, stores it in a database, and provides APIs for the frontend dashboard to visualize and monitor machine health.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Running Locally (Developer Setup)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaieshSharma/force-hackkronyx.git
cd force-hackkronyx

### ‚úÖ Backend Setup

### Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

> If facing any issues, try clearing cache and reinstalling:
```bash
npm ci
```

### Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your backend server should now be running on **http://localhost:5000**.

## ‚úÖ Frontend Setup

### Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd client
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
> If you face issues with dependencies:
```bash
npm install --force
```

### Start the frontend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be running on **http://localhost:5173** (or as specified).


### ‚úÖ Python Simulator Setup

#### Prerequisites
Before running the simulator, make sure you have Python installed and the necessary dependencies.

1. **Install Python**
   - Download and install Python (version 3.8 or later) from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - During installation, check the box **"Add Python to PATH"**

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy matplotlib supervision google-generativeai pandas requests
   ```

3. **Run the Simulator**
   ```bash
   cd machine-stream-simulator
   python main.py
   ```

The simulator will start generating and sending machine sensor data to your backend server. Ensure that your backend server is running before starting the simulator.

---

## üìù Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all servers (backend, frontend, and simulator) are running simultaneously
2. Check that the correct ports are being used and not blocked by firewall
3. Verify that all dependencies are properly installed
4. Check the console logs for specific error messages
