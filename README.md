# üöÄ Project Setup Guide
# üõ†Ô∏è Predictive Maintenance MVP for Manufacturing Units

This project is a working MVP for detecting **unplanned machine downtime** in **mid-sized manufacturing units** using real-time sensor data, predictive analytics, and a clean dashboard interface.

## üåê Project Overview

The system simulates real-time machine data using sensors such as:

- Torque sensors
- Vibration sensors (ADXL345)
- Current sensors (ACS712)
- Temperature sensors (DS18B20)
- Strain gauges (HX711)
- RPM (Hall Effect)
- Operating Hours (RTC + EEPROM)

The backend ingests the simulated data, stores it in a database, and provides APIs for the frontend dashboard to visualize and monitor machine health.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Running Locally (Developer Setup)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaieshSharma/force-hackkronyx.git
cd force-hackkronyx

## ‚úÖ Backend Setup

### Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

> If facing any issues, try clearing cache and reinstalling:
```bash
npm ci
```

### Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your backend server should now be running on **http://localhost:5000**.

## ‚úÖ Frontend Setup

### Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd client
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
> If you face issues with dependencies:
```bash
npm install --force
```

### Start the frontend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be running on **http://localhost:5173** (or as specified).
